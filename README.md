# pixcam

A customizable pixelized webcam display, intended for the shy livestreamer or something. Adjustable pixelation, window size, cropping, and a periodic effect system where you can script your own effects in Python. I made this because I would use it if I ever streamed, and it seemed like it would be fun to make.

Uses Pillow for image stuff, jaraco.video for grabbing webcam frames, TkInter for window stuff.

I plan on having a download here with all the dependencies and stuff sometime soon, I just don't feel like doing it right now and I'd like to work on it more before that anyways.
